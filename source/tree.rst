The tree in-depth
=================

The FINF tree, being encoded in YAML, is built out of the basic
structures common to most dynamic languages: mappings (dict),
sequences (list), and scalars (str, int, float, bool, etc.).  All of
this comes "for free" by using `YAML <http://yaml.org/spec/1.1/>`__.

.. note::

    TODO: The YAML specification is not duplicated here, but long
    term, we probably want to excerpt the important bits here.

.. note::

    **Point for discussion**: OrderedMappings are supported by YAML,
    and could be used to define a canonical ordering of Mapping
    keywords. However, while Python has an OrderedDict that would
    serve well for this purpose, it remains to be seen whether support
    for this concept is good enough in other languages to be relied
    upon, or whether OrderedMappings should remain an optional
    convenience feature of FINF to maintain ordering, but not to
    convey any meaning.

Since these core data structures on their own are so flexible, the
FINF standard includes a number of schema that define the structure of
higher-level content.  For instance, there is a schema that defines
how :ref:`n-dimensional array data
<http://www.stsci.edu/schemas/finf/0.1.0/ndarray>` should be
referenced.  These schema are written in a language called
:ref:`yaml-schema` which is just a thin extension of `JSON Schema,
Draft 4
<http://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-validation.html>`__.  The
chapter, :ref:`schema`, describes all of these schema in detail.

YAML includes the ability to assign :ref:`tags` (or types) to any
object in the tree.  This is an important feature that sets it apart
from other data representation languages, such as JSON.  FINF defines
a number of custom tags, each of which has a corresponding schema.
The tag of the root element of the tree must always be
``tag:stsci.edu:finf/0.1.0/core/finf``.

.. _tags:

Tags
----

Tags declare the data type of an element in the tree.  A FINF parser
may, for example, use this information for schema validation or use it to
convert to a native data type that presents a nice interface to the
user.

For example::

     %YAML 1.1
     --- !<tag:stsci.edu:finf/0.1.0/core/finf>
     data: !<tag:stsci.edu:finf/0.1.0/core/ndarray>
       source: 0
       dtype: float64
       shape: [1024, 1024]
     ...

All tags defined in the FINF standard itself begin with the prefix
``tag:stsci.edu:finf/0.1.0/``.  This can be broken down as:

- ``tag:`` The standard prefix used for all YAML tags.

- ``stsci.edu`` The owner of the tag.

- ``finf`` The name of the standard.

- ``0.1.0`` The version of the standard.

Following that is the tag name itself, for example, ``finf`` or
``ndarray``.  Since it is cumbersome to type out these long prefixes
for every tag, it is recommended to declare a prefix at the top of the
YAML file and use it throughout.  (Most standard YAML writing
libraries have facilities to do this automatically.)  For example, the
following example is equivalent to the above example, but is more
user-friendly.  The ``%TAG`` declaration declares that the exclamation
point (``!``) will be replaced with the prefix
``tag:stsci.edu:finf/0.1.0/``::

      %YAML 1.1
      %TAG ! tag:stsci.edu:finf/0.1.0/
      --- !core/finf
      data: !core/ndarray
        source: 0
        dtype: float64
        shape: [1024, 1024]

A FINF parser may use the tag on an element to look up the corresponding
schema in the FINF standard and validate the element.

.. note::

    TODO: Describe how to convert from a tag name to the URL of a schema
    (hint: it's pretty simple.)

A FINF parser may use the tag information to convert the element to a
native data type.  For example, in Python, a FINF parser may convert a
:ref:`ndarray <http://www.stsci.edu/schemas/finf/0.1.0/core/ndarray>` tag
to a `Numpy <http://www.numpy.org>`__ array, providing a convenient
and familiar interface to the user to access *n*-dimensional data.

The FINF standard does not require parser implementations to validate
or perform native type conversion, however.  A parser may simply leave
the tree represented in the low-level basic data structures.  However,
when writing a FINF file, the elements in the tree must be
appropriately tagged for other tools to make use of them.

FINF parsers must not fail when encountering an unknown tag, but must
simply retain the low-level data structure and the presence of the
tag.  This is important, as end users will likely want to store their
own custom tags in FINF files alongside the tags defined in the FINF
standard itself, and the file must still be readable by FINF parsers
that do not understand those tags.

.. _yaml-schema:

YAML Schema
-----------

YAML Schema is a small extension to `JSON Schema Draft 4
<http://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-validation.html>`__ created
specifically for FINF.
`Understanding JSON Schema
<http://spacetelescope.github.io/understanding-json-schema/>`__
provides a good resource for understanding what it can do.  This
section describes what makes YAML Schema different from JSON Schema,
and provides some examples in the context of FINF.

Writing a new schema is described in :ref:`extending-finf`.

New keywords
^^^^^^^^^^^^

YAML Schema adds two new keywords to JSON Schema.

- ``tag``, which may be attached to any data type, declares that the
  element must have the given YAML tag.  For example, TODO

- ``propertyOrder``, which applies only to objects, declares that the
  object must have its properties presented in the given order.  For
  example, TODO

.. _references:

References
----------

It is possible to directly reference other items within the same tree
or within the tree of another FINF file.  This functionality is based
on two IETF standards: `JSON Pointer (IETF RFC 6901)
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901>`__ and `JSON Reference (Draft 3)
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pbryan-zyp-json-ref-03>`__.

A reference is represented as a mapping with a single key/value pair
where the key is the special keyword ``$ref`` and the value is a URI.
The URI may be absolute or relative.  The URI may contain a fragment
(the part following the ``#`` character) in JSON Pointer syntax that
references a specific element within the external file.  This is a
``/``-delimited path where each element is a mapping key or an array
index.

.. TODO: We should include more details about JSON Pointer.

When these references are resolved, this mapping should be treated as
having the same logical content as the target of the URI, though the
exact details of how this is performed is dependent on the
implementation, i.e., a library may copy the target data into the
source tree, or it may insert a proxy object.

For example, suppose we had a given FINF file containing some shared
reference data, available on a public webserver at the URI
``http://www.nowhere.com/reference.finf``::

    data: !array
      source: 0
      shape: [256, 256]
      dtype: float

Another file may reference this data directly::

    reference_data:
      $ref: "http://www.nowhere.com/reference.finf#data"

It is also possible to use reference files within the same file::

    data: !array
      source: 0
      shape: [256, 256]
      dtype: float
      mask:
        $ref: "#my_mask"

    my_mask: !array
      source: 0
      shape: [256, 256]
      dtype: uint8

Reference resolution should be performed after the entire tree is
read, therefore forward references within the same file are explicitly
allowed.

.. note::
    The YAML standard itself also provides a method for internal
    references called "anchors" and "aliases".  It does not, however,
    support external references.  While FINF does not explicitly
    disallow anchors and aliases, since it explicitly supports all of
    YAML 1.1, their use is discouraged in favor of the more flexible
    JSON Pointer/JSON Reference standard described above.
