  Perform a list of subtransforms in series.

description: |
  The output of each subtransform is fed into the input of the next
  subtransform.

  The number of output dimensions of each subtransform must be equal
  to the number of input dimensions of the next subtransform in list.
  To reorder or add/drop axes, insert ``remap_axes`` transforms in the
  subtransform list.

examples:
  -
    - A series of transforms
    - |
      !transform/series
      - !transform/generic
        n_inputs: 1
        n_outputs: 2
      - !transform/generic
        n_inputs: 2
        n_outputs: 1
