  Represents a RegionsSelector transform.
description: |
  A model which maps regions to their corresponding transforms.

allOf:
  - $ref: transform
  - type: object
    properties:
      mask:
        description: |
          An array with the shape of the detector/observation.
          Pixel values are of type int or str and represent
          region labels as in the RegionSelector transform.
          Pixels which are not within any region have value 0 or " ".

      inputs:
        description: |
          Names of inputs.

          type: string
      outputs:
        description: |
          Names of outputs.

        description: |
          Names of regions.

          type:
            - integer
            - string
      transforms:
        description: |
          A transform for each region. The order should match the order of labels.

      undefined_transform_value:
        description: |
          Value to be returned if there's no transform defined for the inputs.
