  A standard way to serialize a FITS file inside of a FINF file.
description: |
  This schema is useful for distributing FINF files that can
  automatically converted to FITS files by specifying the exact
  content of the resulting FITS file.

  Not all kinds of data in FITS are directly representable in FINF.
  For example, applying an offset and scale to the data using the
  ``BZERO`` and ``BSCALE`` keywords.  In these cases, it will not be
  possible to store the data in the native format from FITS and also
  be accessible in its proper form in the FINF file.
