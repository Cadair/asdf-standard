type: object
properties:
  name:
    description: |
      The name of this step on the WCS transform pipeline.  This name
      may be used by a library to allow the user to say "transform
      from pixel space to the focal plane" without performing the
      entire WCS pipeline.
    type: string

  frames:
    description: |
      The frame for each input axis to this step.
    type: array
    items:
      anyOf:
        - $ref: frame
        - type: 'null'

  units:
    description: |
      The units for each input axis to this step.
    type: array
    items:
      anyOf:
        - $ref: ../unit/unit
        - type: 'null'

  transform:
    description: |
      The transform from this step to the next one.  The
      last step in a WCS should not have a transform, but
      exists only to describe the frames and units of the
      final output axes.
