title: |
  The zenithal equidistant projection.

description: |
  Corresponds to the `ARC` projection in the FITS WCS standard.

  See
  [zenithal](ref:http://stsci.edu/schemas/asdf/0.1.0/transform/zenithal)
  for the definition of the full transformation.

  The pixel-to-sky transformation is defined as:

  $$\theta = 90^\circ - R_\theta$$

  And the sky-to-pixel transformation is defined as:

  $$R_\theta = 90^\circ - \theta$$

  Invertibility: All ASDF tools are required to provide the inverse of
  this transform.
