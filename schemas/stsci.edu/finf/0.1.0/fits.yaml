  A way to serialize a FITS file inside of a FINF file.

  This schema is useful for distributing FINF files that can be easily
  converted to FITS files by specifying the exact content of the
  resulting FITS file.

  Not all kinds of data in FITS are directly representable in FINF.
  For example, applying an implicit offset and scale to the data using
  the ``BZERO`` and ``BSCALE`` keywords.  In these cases, the data
  should be converted to a format that FINF does support before
  storing it in a FINF file.
